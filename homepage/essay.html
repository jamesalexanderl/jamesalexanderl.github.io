            Hello, Welcome to my essay!
        </div>
        <div class="container" m-4>
            <p>Rego Park is my New York. It is made up of the usual New York brick buildings on one side of the block, and grocery stores, 99¢ stores, and a laundromat on the other side. There’s a school that's two blocks away from the three story apartment my family and I live in. There is a mall that's seven blocks down where I get Boba caramel milk tea – it’s delicious! Sometimes I get Chipotle and I am excited for a Korean barbeque place being built where me and my family will go eat. Another mall is ten or so blocks away from this mall and that's where me and my family go to buy clothes. When I take the bus home from school, I know I am near my building when we pass the Jewish school. These are the spots I think of when I think of New York.</p>
            <p>Other stores in Rego Park are “The Chicken Shack”, and the “Rego Garden” which is not what it sounds like. It’s in fact a Chinese restaurant which we get from time to time. My favorite food to get from Rego Garden is “White Rice with Chicken wings. My family’s favorite is “Fried Rice and Chicken Wings. We also ordered spaghetti with a weird sauce in which I forgot the name of. What we order from The Chicken Shack is a whole chicken with fries and a salad. The Location of the Rego Garden is next block down from where I live. The other location of The Chicken Shack is three blocks down next to a Pharmacy and a Starbucks. We also order the food’s online.</p>
            <p>During the daytime, Rego Park is safe to walk around without fear of getting kidnapped or getting robbed. At night, just make sure to close all windows and double lock the doors. Rego Park is my New York because it makes me feel comfortable and happy. The loud cars driving by and the people walking into the stores to get what they need. Other people go into the only Key Food to buy groceries and meat. And buy at least a piece of candy for themselves.</p>
            <p>In Rego Park, sometimes people go to Taco Bell or the Popeyes which is two blocks down and the Burger King which is three to four blocks away. People also go to the gym which is right beside the Burger King. There is a Starbucks right beside the gym which is mostly packed with people doing their work. Additionally, there is a CVS seven blocks away from my apartment where I get my medicine. Although there are many items in the store, the line is unbearably long. Always! No matter what time people go into the store it’s always a long time to check out. This is related to the high population in the area due to convenience of public transportation. Most of transportations is provided by the R train. In addition, public buses like the Q38 and Q76 operate on a daily schedule.
            <p>Queens boulevard is important to Rego Park because when cars pass by people look at the stores and decide if they need anything from them. This is beneficial to Rego Park because it helps it grow and thrive longer for the people who live here. When people buy products from any store business, they thrive. The more products people buy from the store the bigger the tax gets. Which then the taxes go to the local government. Therefore, the local government builds or renovates schools,streets and parks in Rego Park to make it a better place for the community to live in. Since there are many stores with an addition of two malls the tax is high and more renovations are being done.</p>
            <p>The best thing about Rego Park is how the community supports each other. One way is that you can find everything you need. And when we don’t have the store, we build it. People support each other by helping it grow. And so because the neighborhood is successful and growing it helps both sides to create a happy and comfortable place. As time goes on and the community grows, I look forward to new places opening up and new apartment buildings for people to move into and join the area.</p>
